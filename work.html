        <h8>
          As part of the ETF Block desk, I built a full-stack opening-auction testing platform to improve regulation compliance. I also engineered a new instrument pricer, which outperformed the previous model on 99.7% of instances and is now in production. And, not to flex, but I won first place in the intern trading competition :)

          to take classes on finance & management at Wharton for four weeks. Through the rigorous curriculum, I learned a lot about capital allocation and the world of business. I also got to invest in a lot of incredible friendships!

          I was honored to lead Harvard WECode 2024, the world's largest student-run women-in-tech conference, with 1000+ attendees from 25+ countries. In 2024, I revamped our finances & offerings to quadruple our annual revenue ($50k to $200k) to provide travel & lodging stipends to hundreds of attendees. Encouraging women to pursue tech is a cause I care deeply about, and one I hope to continue contributing to in the future.

        <h8>
          Harvard's residential life has given me a wonderful sense of community, so I decided to give back this year by serving as my house's events chair with my roommate. We hosted events every other week for over 400 students, with creative themes each time. Some of events included a live band competition, Harvard-Yale shot-glass decorating, and a game night!

        <h8>
         In high school, journalism was my life. I started out as a reporter, then fell in love with graphics and page design, before finally serving as editor in chief of the 80-person staff my senior year. My roots in storytelling, design, and data analysis start here. Fundamentally, HiLite showed me how fulfilling it is to put your all into creating something meaningful -- a feeling I've been chasing ever since. </h8>

              Inspired by interests in sound-boarding and animation, I built a full-stack website using Flask/HTML/CSS/Javascript as a social media platform for users to  share audio sounds. It has functionality for users to upload and record their own sounds, explore the sounds of others, save sounds, and also has basic account configuration & privacy settings.

              Growing up, I loved to participate in math competitions. Doing math was the first activity that consumed my whole attention; competition math used my creativity, love of elegant problem solving, and competitive streak all at once.
              As a result of this fascination, I was fortunate enough to participate in National MATHCOUNTS in 2017, score a perfect on the AMC-8 in 2016, and qualify for the AIME five times (and score on AMC 10/12 Distinguished Honor Roll 5-times).
              Most notably, I ranked third in my grade level at MathPrize for Girls in 2018, and was invited to participate in the MathPrize for Girls Olympiad.
              <br><br>
              My writing + design work has also been recognized nationally. The newsmagazine I led, The HiLite, won Print & Web Pacemaker awards, dubbed the Pulitzer Prize of Scholastic Journalism,
               as well as a Columbia Scholastic Press Association Gold Crown. My personal work won the Center of Scholastic Journalism's $500 Award for Covering Activism.
               I also won a "Best of the Best" Award from the Women's Press Club of Indiana, a First Place Prize on environment-related coverage from the National Federation of Press Women, 
               and a Best of Sno award for my cover story. My photo illustration work got an Honorable Mention from Quill & Scroll, and I was a National Scholastic Press Assocation finalist for 
               interactive graphic of the year -- a precursor to my later work in college in interactive data visualization!!
